## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER   
All IP addresses, systems, and assets referenced in these reports are **from isolated lab environments**.  
No real client data or sensitive organizational information is included.

Although the lab environment utilized realistic infrastructure and attack surfaces, **all systems were isolated, internal, and not tied to any real clients or production networks.**

## 🎯 Internship Focus Areas  
Throughout my internship, I worked on multiple security domains, including:

- Web Application Penetration Testing  
- Internal Network Enumeration & Vulnerability Analysis  
- CTF-Style Threat Hunting Challenges  
- GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) Assessment  
- Documentation & Technical Reporting  
- Architecture & Topology Security Review  

These reports demonstrate my ability to investigate, analyze, exploit, defend, and professionally articulate cybersecurity findings.
